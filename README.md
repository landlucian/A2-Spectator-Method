# Leaving the Orion Drift Community

Hey everyone,

After much thought, Iâ€™ve decided to step away from the Orion Drift scene. Itâ€™s been a long journey, full of bullshit, src leajs, and the 10 minutes of me figuring out exit_spec.

Since i made, and started this whole cheating thing for orion drift, I wanted to share something useful for those who want to use spectator but dont have access.

## First Method


1. **Obtain a build** of orion drift spectator.  
   - You can find an archive of builds [here](https://dl.obelous.dev/unlisted/spectator).  

2. **Run it offline.**  
   - Download the `offline.bat` [here](https://github.com/landlucian/A2-Spectator-Method/blob/main/startoffline.bat), then put it where the `A2.exe` is located.  
   - This can be used to load the main map without connecting to mothership entitlement.

## Second Method

1. **Obtain a build** of orion drift spectator.  
   - You can find an archive of builds [here](https://dl.obelous.dev/unlisted/spectator).  

2. **Download UE Unlocker**
   - You can download it [here](https://github.com/landlucian/A2-Spectator-Method/raw/refs/heads/main/UUU_v5.7.3.rar).

3. **Load Map**
 - Once you are in the game, inject ue unlocker, then run `open Station_Prime_P`.
 - It is fine if the ui does not pop up, as long as the actual mouse is showing just paste, and press enter.

## ðŸ’¬ Closing Thoughts

People think that unreal engine is this super protected uncheatable software for quest, and pc. While it takes 2 15 year olds fucking around 10 minutes to cheat by a game made a massive indie studio that makes millions of dollars every year.
I hope others like stella, korp, and drycheetah continue doing what they do best.
This project taught me more about how shitty another axiom and meta are, and how they do not care about the community than I ever expected.  

Thanks for being part of the journey, keep pasting!
